        <p> Here's a spot you could stick some side content relavent to the page you're on.  There's also a special link class for anything you decide to put here: </p>
        <div class="links"> <a href="#">Pinecone Theme</a> <a href="#">ThreeTree</a> <a href="#">FullAhead</a> </div>
        <p> Tried for an open and soft design on this one.  You can see the similarities in this design proposal I did last month. </p>

        <p> <span class="date">2005.08.20</span> Played in the Tree-oh discgolf tournament.  Went pretty well, but the body is not happy about the 8 hours of play ... <a href="#"><img src="images/link_arrow.gif" alt="" /></a> </p>
        <p> <span class="date">2005.08.16</span> Tires suck.  Went to get my bike out of my friends garage - flat tire.  Next day, the car decides to do the same ... <a href="#"><img src="images/link_arrow.gif" alt="" /></a> </p>

      <h1> Template </h1>
      <p> A tableless <acronym title="eXtensible Hyptertext Markup Language">XHTML</acronym>/<acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym> template that focuses on customization.  After the success of my last template, reflection, I decided to stick with the "easy-to-modify" theme.  The header is simple to change for one of your own, as is the accent colour.  You can see the result <a href="#" title="pinecone version">here</a>. </p>
      <p class="quote"> To change the accent colour, search the style sheet for <acronym title="hexidecimal: base 16 numbering system">hex</acronym> value <acronym title="red">#BE0000</acronym> and replace it with one of your own.  The top header image is added by the #header class definition. <span class="bottom">&nbsp;</span> </p>
      <h2> Semantically Coded </h2>
      <p> This template is coded using the <acronym title="fancy name for HTML tags">markup</acronym> as it was intended.  The result is code that is simple to understand and widely supported in different browsers.  Another benefit is that <acronym title="fancy word for browsers">user agents</acronym> that don't support CSS will still display the site's content coherently.  You can test it yourself by disabling CSS in your browser. </p>
      <h1> Specs </h1>
      <p> <img src="images/firefox.jpg" alt="" class="right"/> Softened Cells is a fixed width template that will work out of the box at <acronym title="WIDTH by HEIGHT measurement of screen resolution in pixels">640x480</acronym> and above.  You can change this if you want by altering the width definitions of the #siteBox, #news and #text CSS classes. </p>
      <p> Browser support for the template is very good because of the simple markup structure.  It renders consitently in the following: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Firefox</li>
        <li>Netscape</li>
        <li>Opera</li>
        <li>Safari</li>
        <li><acronym title="dirty, dirty Internet Explorer">IE</acronym> (Windows/Mac)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2> Images </h2>
      <p> Images are fully supported using the two custom CSS classes <acronym title="image will align right">.right</acronym> and <acronym title="image will align left">.left</acronym>.  Simply place an image in the paragraph you'd like, apply the class and you're done.  Headings &lt;h1&gt; and sub headings &lt;h2&gt; act as boundaries, so you're images will always remain in context. </p>
      <h1> Big Links </h1>
      <p> One last thing for you to play with is the .links CSS class.  It lets you create large link blocks in your content for whatever you want to emphasis.  I used them on my site for the portfolio and links sections. </p>
      <ul class="links">
        <li> <a href="#"> <span class="title">Deviant ART</span> <span class="desc">Just about the largest art site on the Interweb.</span> <span class="bottom">&nbsp;</span> </a> </li>
        <li> <a href="#"> <span class="title">CSS Zen Garden</span> <span class="desc">Showcasing what is possible using only pure CSS design.</span> <span class="bottom">&nbsp;</span> </a> </li>
        <li> <a href="#"> <span class="title">FullAhead</span> <span class="desc">My design portfolio site (completely shameless plug).</span> <span class="bottom">&nbsp;</span> </a> </li>
      </ul>
      <h1> Terms of Use </h1>
      <p> The template is released for free, but I would appreciate it you gave me, <a href="http://fullahead.org" title="http://fullahead.org">FullAhead</a>, credit.  If you keep either of the header images that come with the template, you should also leave a link to <a href="http://threetree.net" title="http://threetree.net">ThreeTree</a>, since he took them. </p>
      <p> If you end up using this template, send me an message.  It's always interesting to see how people modify my work.  I enjoyed making it, so I hope you enjoy using it. </p>
