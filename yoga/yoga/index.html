        <h3>H3 - Room for Another Section Header</h3>
        <p><strong>This template was designed by people who understand the importance of search engine optimization</strong>, and is therefore search engine friendly. For instance, it uses CSS, clean code, H1,H2, H3 tags, has a footer sitemap, an html sitemap, a yoga sites page so you can add resources, etcetera. Don't forget to customize the titles and meta tags on each page!</p>
        <h3> H3 - How To Use This Free Yoga Website Template</h3>
        <p>This is your home page. It is called index.html. We have also created an inside page for your inside pages (<a href="insidepage.html">insidepage.html</a>), as well as a sitemap (<a href="sitemap.html">sitemap.html</a>), and a <a href="yoga-sites.html">yoga sites page</a> to add further resources for your readers. The main parts of the website are controlled through a dreamweaver template located in the /templates folder and titled main.dwt. Certain sections, such as the body content, are editable independent of the template simply be editing each page in Dreamweaver. These are called &quot;editable regions&quot;. We chose to create the template like this to make it easy for those who are not experienced with PHP to make sitewide changes. For instance, if you change the title of a llink in the navigation from the main.dwt template and save the file in Dreamweaver it will change the navigation on the entire site to match. That's much easier than changing every page! However, certain things  (i.e. meta tags, titles, content...) that need to be different on each page so we have created editable regions in the template that allow you to make each page unique. </p>
