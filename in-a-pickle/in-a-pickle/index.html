    <h1>Everyone loves pickles</h1>
    <div class="copy">Well, everyone I know does anyway. And most everyone loves free stuff - like this template. It's free for you to download and modify as you wish - no strings attached. I would, however, appreciate it if you leave the credit for the original Design to me in the footer. </div>
    <div class="copy">If you like this Design and decide to use it, drop me an email at info@websiteDesignbasics.com and let me know what you did with it. Thanks. </div>
    <h2>Pickle history</h2>
    <div class="copy">This is a simple, two-column layout with lots of white space and soothing green shades. The font is Georgia and is set at a comfortable size for easy reading. </div>
    <div class="copy"><img src="pickle5.jpg" width="120" height="137" alt="" />The only graphics included are the big pickle and the &quot;quote&quot; mark graphic for the blockquote so the page loads very fast. You'll most likely want to replace the big pickle with something else - unless you're a pickle nut like me - mmmmmm, pickles! When you replace it I suggest using a cut out graphic instead of a boring rectangle to retain the sense of white space, but it's your template now, so knock yourself out. I am always interested to see what people do with templates I create so feel free to let me know what you've used it for. </div>
    <div id="quote"><img src="quote.gif" width="47" height="34" alt="" />Oh, Hamlet, how camest thou in such a pickle? (Act 5, Scene 1.) </div>
    <h3>Pickle facts</h3>
    <div class="copy">Pickling is one of the oldest forms of food preservation. Although many vegetables are also sold in pickled form, gherkins/cucumbers (fruits) are the leading pickled food in the world, giving rise to the misnomer commonly known as "Pickles".</div>
