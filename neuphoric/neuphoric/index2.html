<div id="content"> <strong>This template is a modified version of tristar&rsquo;s</strong>
  <h2>changes.</h2>
  The changes in this alternative version, compared to the default version are:
  <ul>
    <li>Font size not set</li>
    <li>Font-family not set</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The reason for this is:</p>
  <p>I am trying to get the focus for my templates on usability/accessability. The font size/family is not set so that the user can easily adjust
    their browser to how they like it. For more detail, please read the links below: <br />
    Why not to over-ride the reader&rsquo;s font size</p>
  <p>So while this can make the design less attractive, it is easier for those that want better control of their font.
    If you find the text too big, change it, or read the link below to learn how<br />
    Adjusting your text size</p>
  <p>If anyone can give me links etc on how to improve accesability, I would be very happy to read them. Please use the
    email option on my OWD user page.</p>
