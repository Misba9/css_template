  <h2>changes.</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Width has been set to 85%</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Want it wider? Easy. In the styles.css file, do a find and replace. Swap 75 for 85, and then 73 for 83. That will get this page you are looking
    at now. It is that easy to adjust.</p>
  <h2>design.notes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>800x600 and up (Can stretch to 2000px wide without the banner running out)</li>
    <li>valid xhtml/css</li>
    <li>looks great! (not open to subjective dispute)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I have heard a few people complaining about the lack of fluid designs. With the increase
    of larger screens and higher resolutions, some people are getting sick of looking at a small thing
    in the middle of the screen</p>
  <p>A problem with fluid designs is that once the content stretches wide, the line lengths become
    rather long, and are harder to read. Hopefully because the content on this is 75% wide, the line lengths
    do not become too wide.</p>
